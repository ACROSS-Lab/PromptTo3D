# Scripts folder
In this folder you can run any of the pipelines available. 
There are 3 text_to_image models :
* SD (for Stable Diffusion)
* SDF (for Stable Diffusion Finetuned)
* MVD (for MVDream)

And there are 2 image_to_3D models : CRM and triposr

Thus for example if you want to run a gradio interface using Stable Diffusion then CRM you just have to run the following line
```
python SD_CRM.py
```
