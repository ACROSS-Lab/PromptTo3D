# PromptTo3D
In the context of the Simple project, it is needed to have an efficient model that allows to generate a 3D asset from a prompt.
Thus we adapted two models; the CRM and the LRM, that are image to 3D assets models. we used a stablediffusion model for the prompt to image part. In order to create a 3D asset from a prompt, please check the README.md files in the CRM and the LRM folders.
