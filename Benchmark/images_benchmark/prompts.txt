A cactus with pink flowers
An antique wooden rocking horse
A bright red fire hydrant
A plush teddy bear with a satin bow
A tarnished brass pocket watch
A small porcelain white rabbit figurine
A partly broken shell of a tortoise
A well-used black iron frying pan
An antique glass perfume bottle
A polished mahogany grand piano
A chipped porcelain teacup
A cracked porcelain doll's face
A sleek, slim smartphone
A rusty, abandoned bicycle
A shiny, new electric guitar
An intricate ceramic vase with peonies painted on it
A fuzzy pink flamingo lawn ornament
An elegant feather-quill ink pen
A fragrant pine Christmas wreath
A silver mirror with ornate detailing
