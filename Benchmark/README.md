# Benchmark

This repositories focuses on our tentatives to build a Benchmark for the 3D assets evaluation. It was inspired from [T3Bench](https://github.com/THU-LYJ-Lab/T3Bench). The logic remains the same, we consider views of an icosahedron, but this time we're not using Chat-GPT 4.0 to evaluate the views but a BLIP model that is supposed to be specialised in image recognition.
⚠⚠⚠ Most script require a screen device and won't work on a screenless server.

## The python scripts
### 3DBench.py
This script was the first one coded to do an automated evaluation on 3D assets. It uses Blip models and different views given the chosen method. 
### Visualisation3D.py
This script was a first draft on a human evaluation to compare 2 assets generated by image-to-3D models such as CRM or Triposr. It creates a tkinter interface that opens the asset in a window and the user can spin it as he wants. 
Keep in mind that it was really a first draft, and after that we decided to use the .glb format for the images generated by the CRM..
